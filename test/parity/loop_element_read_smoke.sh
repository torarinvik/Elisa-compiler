# site (`xs <- v`, `xs.push(v)`) that widens the container's element state is rejected at the
# adding site: a later iteration's read was checked only against the elements added before it.

#   1. rejected/*.elisa: both reject, no object, identical path-stripped errors;
#   2. accepted/*.elisa: both accept with a non-empty object.
